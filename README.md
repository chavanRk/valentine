# 💖 Valentine

This is a simple, mobile-friendly Valentine website created with ❤️ to celebrate love and our journey together.  
It is designed especially for mobile devices and works perfectly on Android phones. The website features a multi-slide experience, smooth animations, floating hearts, and a live counter that shows how long we’ve been together — starting from **10th May 2025 and counting forever**.

The project is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external libraries or frameworks. It can be opened locally in any browser or shared as a live link using GitHub Pages. When opened on Android Chrome, it can also be added to the home screen and used like a small app.

This project is meant for personal use and memories, created with love and care.
